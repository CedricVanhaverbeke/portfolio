              My name is Cedric. I'm a software engineer from Belgium. I like
              searching for a solutions that are both technically elegant and
              maintainable in the long term. Programming and technology aside,
              you'll often see me running, cycling or swimming. I also like
              playing the guitar. I'll probably never say no to a good stout üç∫.
