#### With generative AI, I mean models that create images, text, songs, etc...

"Look what I can do with this simple prompt," said Bill while showing off his new crossbreed between a cat and a dog eating a hot dog.
However, Bill didn't do a single thing. He asked a multibillion-dollar model to generate an image based on genuine art produced by talented people who actually gave a crap and spent more than 10 seconds figuring out what they wanted to make, neglecting the impact his keystrokes had.

You probably get my scepticism right off the bat. Look, it's cool what these models produce. At its best, it's even actually usable and handy.

Everyone and their grandmother is using AI in some obscure product, and every major company is looking for a way to monetize the fuck out of this.
And they need to figure that out quickly. The money is running out. If generative AI cannot solve a billion-dollar problem in the coming years, it will be game over.
Because in order to build the admittedly cool AI models, a lot of money is needed. Various sources claim different things, but their ballpark is around the same: in the fucking billions.

## In the fucking billions

Let me repeat that. In the fucking billions. And let me tell you something else. They don't profit anywhere close to what they're spending to run the model. So what's the business model here?
It seems that the answer to this question is always the same: getting you completely addicted up until there's no going back to the old days without a "copilot."  

They take away your imagination by pretending you are still the working force behind the AI. Are you really? You prompt something, and the AI does all the work for you. How is that a "copilot"? They make you inhale this artificially generated mess and pretend like it's the best thing in the world. But is it really?

## Mediocre at best

Remember this: A model is trained on data provided by the internet. You probably know it—it's this shitshow of a place where people do and post the most absurd stuff. On the other hand, if you scrape some of the dogshit away, you'll find some gems. So what do you get when you take bad content and mix it with good content? Indeed, you get mediocre content.

And that's all these chatbots and generative image creators are. Just plain mediocre. But hey, it'll only improve from here, right? That's what investors hope. And that's certainly what companies like OpenAI hope.
They really need it to become better. After all, more people need to use and pay for it so they can actually fix their business model to maybe become profitable. It's either that or find an actual billion-dollar use case.

## Start thinking

Manipulating people is easy enough. So why not give them the means to form opinions based on wrong information? People use ChatGPT like it's Google. I even saw people use it as a simple calculator. And why should we blame them? We're marketing this new trend as a know-it-all bot with all the answers. We're presenting it for free, like it has no impact on anything.

Well, it does. Training an AI model costs a lot of energy. Back in university, I had to casually train my small neural network with `scikit-learn`. When I needed to train my model on what I considered a lot of data, it sometimes had to train for an entire night. And not on my laptop—no. I needed a PC with a graphics card to actually get on with the training. So now imagine doing the same, but with the _entire_ internet. We cannot even begin to understand what kind of power that takes. It's insane.
Microsoft bought a goddamn nuclear power plant, for god's sake. And for reference, Microsoft bought OpenAI. They clearly need energy for these new technologies.  

To conclude: We're using models that often produce crap that consume ludicrous amounts of energy. Thanks, big tech!

## Concerning programming

Let's take it back a notch and talk about my daily struggles with generative AI when programming.  

Every day I see people blindly copying answers from ChatGPT and pasting it in their code.
Every day I see someone proving that something is possible in a way they figured out by asking ChatGPT, and now I just need to "include the code in the project."  

I was going to write a rant about these people. But instead, I realized I'm just sad.
AI seems like an awesome shortcut to mundane problems, and sometimes it might actually be. If I had access to ChatGPT or Copilot when I was studying, I probably would've used them too. But I'm really glad I didn't.

One of the major appeals of copilots when programming is that they have more context than your average Google search, down to the names of the variables you used.
For people new to the field, this is huge. You don't actually need to understand what is going wrong. You don't need to formulate the question in a way other people might have also encountered it.

This is one of the biggest drawbacks of using AI. You don't actually need to figure out what went wrong. And you only get better at identifying problems by doing it a lot.
But why bother? If you have access to it, what stops you from using it? Fair point. If you read all of the text, you probably know what my reply will be.
I think those tools either will get very expensive or they'll just disappear. Your "prompt knowledge" will suddenly just be irrelevant.

You know, I get it. Generating boilerplate is genuinely nice. So by all means, do that. But stop using it for serious development. Think about what you want to achieve and how you'll achieve it.
**ChatGPT DOES NOT THINK**. Stop pretending it does.

And the world tells you that the next decades will be dominated by so-called prompt engineers. So be my guest, become one.
I'll just wait for the flood of issues coming in that need to be fixed by a human who actually understands what was written.

#### And yes, I'm a hypocrite. I let AI make corrections to my text.
